The dataset used this project is retrieved from kaggle, the home of Data Science. There are three parts to our report, as follows:

- Data Cleaning and Feature Engineering
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Prediction of Loan Status


The major objective of this project is to predict whether the bank will approve the loan based on certain information. Therefore, this is a supervised classification problem to be trained. Algorithms tested for this project include Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, KNearest Neighbors, Support Vector Classifier and XGBoost Classifier. Hyperparametric tuning will be performed by sklearn's GridSearchCV. We will compare the results of these models to discover which algorithm works better for this specific dataset.
